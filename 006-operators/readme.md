# Operators

```
Operators contribute a lot to any programming language! let's learn.

```

+ , - ,* ,/ 

/  : a/b  = 3/2 = 1.5 ( Regular Division ) 
// : a//b = 3/2 = 1   ( Floating Divison )
Modulos : This is like fetching the reminder of a divsion 20/3 : 2 is the reminder.

In python : 

```
 /        :  Division 
% Modulus : Reminder

10/3   :  3.3  ( divison )
10//3  :  3    ( floating division)
10 %3  : 1   ( reminder )

a = 3
a += 2 = a + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5   ( +=  addition assignment operator)
a -=1  = a - 1 = 3 - 1 =3 

```

### Identity Operator : is 

```
a is b : If a and b are same , the it returns true if not false
```

### Logical Operations 
```
    true AND true   = true 
    true AND false  = false
    false AND false = fasle 
```
