# Scenario : We want to fetch the information of our AWS Account Resources and display that.
# And also I don't have access to AWS Console On Production Account as I am consultant and I don't have access, how can we do that ??? 
# This can be achieved with python ( list of ec2, ecr, eks or anything of our choice ) and we want this info to be accessed by the other teammates using NGINX.

# First, let's serve the sample application using sample hello world.
# Google ---> Python Hello World Web Program
