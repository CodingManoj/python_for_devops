# Python is  a dynamic type language , so you don't have to mention the datatype, it takes of it's won

a=100
b=300
pyt=True   # Booleans
gol=False  

Similary, we have list and map. 
list1=[10,20,30]    # which is a list 
print(list1)

# map
map1 = {
    "name": "manoj"
    "age": "35"
    "content": "devops
}
print(map1)
print(map1["age"])

# On your python CLI, you can even access these variables just by typing :
# map1 , list1



# Defining functions ( In python Indendation is mandatory)
