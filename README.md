### Points to be nodes :
    1. Python is a dynamical type language
    2. Python is indendation specific
    3. After you declare a function, it should start with a tab space. 
    4. Functions and Modules are different
    5. Always prefer to use _ in the fileNames, when you want to use a file as a module in another file, then import will fail.
