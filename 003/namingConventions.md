# Naming Conventions 

```
    Naming Conventions Are Really Important In Python !!!!!
```
### How variables are supposed to be declared :

```
    1. delcare using lowerCase    ( name )
            or 
    2. snake casing ( ec2_instance_name  ) : Separate them using  _ (coding_manoj)
            or 
    3. Camel case if you've a variable name with multiple strings (codingManoj)
